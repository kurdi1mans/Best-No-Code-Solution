# Best No Code Solution

Curated markdown notes on popular no-code/low-code platforms with quick pros/cons for each.

## Structure
- [platforms/index.md](platforms/index.md) — grouped links to all platform notes.
- `platforms/*.md` — individual platform assessments (summary, strengths, limitations, best-fit, pricing snapshot, integrations).
- [criteria/README.md](criteria/README.md) — lists the evaluation criteria

## Contributing
- Add new platforms as separate markdown files in `platforms/` and link them from `platforms/index.md`.
- Keep bullets concise and vendor-neutral; focus on practical trade-offs and when to choose or avoid a tool.

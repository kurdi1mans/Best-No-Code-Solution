# Evaluation Criteria (Working Draft)

Use these prompts to assess each no-code/low-code platform. Keep notes concise and vendor-neutral; no scoring yet.

- Data & Modeling
	- Data model limits: record/field limits, schema evolution, migrations, import/export quality (CSV/JSON/API), bulk ops performance
	- Data types: text/number/decimal, regex/validation, rich content, attachments (single/multi), images/files, geo, array/object, enums
	- Data quality: constraints, uniqueness, referential integrity, dedupe/merge support
	- Computation: formula language depth (string/date/array), cross-table lookups, reusable functions/components, debugging/tracing
	- Evaluation behavior: recalculation timing, dependency handling, eventual vs. strong consistency impacts on UX and reports
- Logic, Workflows, Automation
	- Builders and paradigms: visual vs. code-first scripting, branching/looping/state management complexity
	- Triggers/background jobs/schedulers; human-in-the-loop steps and SLAs
	- Integrations as workflow steps; retries, idempotency, dead-letter handling, observability for runs
	- Transactionality: ACID/isolation, concurrency/locking, rollback/undo options, compensation patterns
- Integrations & Extensibility
	- Connectors/APIs: native connectors, REST/GraphQL quality, webhooks, rate limits/quotas, auth patterns (API keys/OAuth/service accounts)
	- Data movement: sync cadence, change data capture, event streaming/message bus support
	- Extensibility: SDKs/plugins, custom components/actions, middleware hooks, packaging/sharing across projects
- Identity & Access
	- Auth: native auth, SSO/OIDC/SAML, SCIM, MFA, passwordless/social; delegated/consent flows
	- Session/user lifecycle: provisioning, suspension, expiration, session management
	- Authorization: RBAC/ABAC, row/field-level controls, share links and scoping, approval flows for elevated access
- Security & Compliance
	- Encryption: in-transit/at-rest defaults, key management (KMS/BYOK), tenant isolation
	- Governance: audit logs, backups/retention, policy enforcement, secret handling, incident posture, admin controls/guardrails for citizen devs
	- Compliance/residency: SOC2/ISO/HIPAA, DPAs, data residency choices, portability/retention controls, self-host/SaaS region options
	- DR/BCP: backups, restores, RPO/RTO clarity, cross-region redundancy
- Performance & Operations
	- Runtime: latency, caching/CDN, cold starts, scaling behavior and multi-tenant isolation, noisy-neighbor protections
	- Reliability: uptime/SLA track record, maintenance windows, throttling behavior under load, offline/degeneration behavior
	- Observability: built-in analytics/logs, tracing/error monitoring, alerting hooks and exports
	- Hosting/control: SaaS vs. self-host, infra choices, sandbox environments, vendor lock-in, migration paths/tooling
- UI/UX & App Experience
	- View types: grid/kanban/calendar/Gantt/gallery/map/tree, filters/sort/group, conditional formatting
	- Layout/theming: responsive controls, component quality, styling/theme options/design tokens, localization/i18n, accessibility support
	- Surfaces: web, mobile (native/PWA), desktop; offline/low-bandwidth behavior, installability
- Collaboration, Delivery, Governance
	- Multi-user editing: conflict handling, change history/rollback, auditability of configuration changes
	- Environments: branching, review/deploy workflows, preview links, release approvals/separation of duties
	- Testing/quality: unit/integration/UI testing hooks, CI/CD integration, feature flags/safe rollout patterns
	- Guardrails/templates: policies, reusable templates/blocks, linting or policy-as-code to keep citizen devs compliant
- AI & Assistance
	- AI copilots/builders: schema suggestions, UI generation, promptable workflows
	- Model support: text/vision embeddings, calling external LLMs, fine-tuning/grounding options, safety controls
- Commercials & Ecosystem
	- Pricing/TCO: seat/usage/record/ops models, overage risks, required add-ons/hidden costs, migration/exit costs/contract terms
	- Marketplace/support: template depth, community health, docs quality, support tiers/SLAs/responsiveness
	- Open-source posture: license/self-host maturity, upgrade path, cloud vs. OSS gaps, maintenance cadence

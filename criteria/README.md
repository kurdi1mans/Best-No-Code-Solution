# Evaluation Criteria (Suggested)

Use these criteria to assess each no-code/low-code platform. Do not start scoring yet.

- **Use case fit:** Primary strengths (web app, mobile, internal tools, automation, CMS, forms) and misfits.
- **Data model & limits:** Supported data types/relations, row/storage/throughput limits, and API quotas.
- **Logic & workflows:** Native logic model (workflows, formulas, scripting), background jobs, triggers, and branching complexity.
- **Integrations & extensibility:** Native connectors, webhooks/API quality, SDKs/plugins, ability to embed custom code.
- **Hosting & control:** SaaS vs. self-host options, data residency, backups/exports, and vendor lock-in considerations.
- **Security & governance:** Auth, RBAC, SSO, audit logs, environment management, and compliance (SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR tools).
- **Performance & reliability:** Runtime performance, caching/CDN, uptime/SLA, cold starts, and scaling behavior.
- **Collaboration & versioning:** Multi-user editing, change history, branching/environments, and review/deploy workflows.
- **Design & UX flexibility:** Theming, responsive controls, component quality, accessibility support, and localization/i18n.
- **Analytics & observability:** Built-in analytics/logs, error tracking, monitoring, and alerting hooks.
- **Pricing & TCO:** Plan structure (seats/usage/records/ops), overage risks, required add-ons, and migration costs.
- **Ecosystem & support:** Marketplace depth, community templates, documentation quality, SLAs, and support tiers.
- **Compliance & data residency:** Available certifications, region choices, DPA availability, and data portability.
- **Deployment targets:** Web, mobile (native/PWA), desktop, or API-only; app store readiness if relevant.

# Evaluation Criteria (Suggested)

Use these criteria to assess each no-code/low-code platform. Do not start scoring yet.

  - **Data model & limits**
    - Supported data types/relations; schema flexibility
    - Row/storage/throughput limits and API quotas
    - Import/export and migration tooling

    - Formula language capability: function breadth (string/date/array), cross-table references/lookups, reusable functions/components
    - Type system, error handling, and debugging/tracing tools
    - Evaluation behavior: recalculation timing, dependencies, and performance on large datasets
  - **Files & attachments**
    - Upload/storage limits and supported types
    - CDN/performance and regional storage
    - Versioning, inline preview, access controls, virus scanning
- **Application logic & integration**
  - **Transactional integrity**
    - ACID support and isolation levels
    - Concurrency control and locking

    - Rate limits, throttling, and quotas
    - Authentication patterns for integrations (API keys, OAuth)
  - **Extensibility**
    - SDKs/plugins, custom components/actions, and scripting
    - Webhooks, events, and middleware hooks
    - Packaging/sharing of extensions across projects
- **Security, identity, and compliance**

    - Native auth, SSO/OIDC/SAML, SCIM, MFA
    - Session management, user provisioning/lifecycle
    - Passwordless/social options
  - **Access control**
    - Roles and row/field-level permissions
    - Sharing/link settings and environment scoping
    - Builder control over data access policy
  - **Encryption**
    - In-transit and at-rest defaults
    - Key management (KMS/BYOK) and data isolation
  - **Security & governance**
    - Audit logs, backups/retention, policy enforcement
    - Environment management, incident posture
    - Secrets handling and least-privilege patterns
  - **Compliance & data residency**
    - Certifications (SOC2, ISO, HIPAA), DPAs, region choices
    - Data portability and retention controls
    - Residency/configuration options (self-host/SaaS regions)
- **Performance & operations**
  - **Performance & reliability**
    - Runtime performance, caching/CDN, cold starts
    - Scaling behavior and multi-tenant isolation
    - Uptime/SLA and reliability track record
  - **Analytics & observability**
    - Built-in analytics/logs, error tracking, monitoring
    - Alerting hooks, exports, and third-party integration

    - Multi-user editing and change history
    - Branching/environments and review/deploy workflows
    - Merge conflict handling and rollback
  - **Hosting & control**
    - SaaS vs. self-host options; data residency and backups/exports
    - Vendor lock-in and migration paths
    - Infrastructure choices and sandboxing environments
- **UI/UX**
  - **Views & UI flexibility**
    - View types: grid/kanban/calendar/Gantt/gallery/map/hierarchical/tree/etc.
    - Column/view customization: filters/sorting/grouping, conditional formatting
    - Responsive behavior and custom views/components
  - **Design & UX flexibility**
    - Theming and component quality
    - Responsive controls and layout systems

# Evaluation Criteria (Suggested)

Use these criteria to assess each no-code/low-code platform. Do not start scoring yet.

- **Use case fit**
  - Primary strengths (web app, mobile, internal tools, automation, CMS, forms)
  - Where it is a poor fit
- **Data model & limits**
  - Supported data types and relations
  - Row/storage/throughput limits and API quotas
- **Logic & workflows**
  - Workflows, formulas, scripting model, triggers, background jobs
  - Branching and complexity limits
- **Integrations & extensibility**
  - Native connectors, webhook/API quality, SDKs/plugins
  - Ability to embed or run custom code
- **Files & attachments**
  - Upload/storage limits, supported types, CDN/performance
  - Versioning, inline preview, access controls, and virus scanning
- **Hosting & control**
  - SaaS vs. self-host, data residency, backups/exports
  - Vendor lock-in considerations and migration paths
- **Access control**
  - Roles, row/field-level permissions, sharing/link settings
  - Environment scoping and builder control over data access
- **Authentication**
  - Native auth, SSO/OIDC/SAML, SCIM, MFA
  - Session management and user provisioning flows
- **Encryption**
  - In-transit and at-rest defaults
  - Key management (KMS/BYOK) and data isolation options
- **Security & governance**
  - Audit logs, backups/retention, policy enforcement
  - Environment management, incident posture, and secrets handling
- **Performance & reliability**
  - Runtime performance, caching/CDN, cold starts, scaling behavior
  - Uptime/SLA and reliability track record
- **Views & UI flexibility**
  - View types (grid/kanban/calendar/Gantt/gallery/map/hierarchical/tree/etc.)
  - Column/view customization, filters/sorting/grouping, conditional formatting
  - Responsive behavior and ability to build custom views/components
- **Transactional integrity**
  - ACID support, concurrency control, isolation levels
  - Rollback/undo and suitability for financial/banking-grade consistency
- **Collaboration & versioning**
  - Multi-user editing, change history, branching/environments
  - Review/deploy workflows and merge conflict handling
- **Design & UX flexibility**
  - Theming, component quality, responsive controls
  - Accessibility support and localization/i18n
- **Analytics & observability**
  - Built-in analytics/logs, error tracking, monitoring
  - Alerting hooks and export options
- **Pricing & TCO**
  - Plan model (seats/usage/records/ops) and overage risks
  - Required add-ons and migration/exit costs
- **Ecosystem & support**
  - Marketplace depth, templates, community health
  - Documentation quality, SLAs, and support tiers
- **Open-source posture**
  - License, self-host maturity, and upgrade path
  - Community health and feature gaps vs. cloud editions
- **Compliance & data residency**
  - Certifications (SOC2, ISO, HIPAA), DPAs, and region choices
  - Data portability and retention controls
- **Deployment targets**
  - Web, mobile (native/PWA), desktop, or API-only

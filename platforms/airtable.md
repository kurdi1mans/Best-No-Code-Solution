# Airtable
**Category:** Database/spreadsheet hybrid

- **Summary:** Relational spreadsheet with views, automations, and extensions for building data backends.
- **Strengths:**
  - Familiar spreadsheet UX with relational features and views (grid, kanban, form, interface).
  - Built-in automations, scripts, and interfaces reduce need for external tools.
  - Strong API for connecting to front-ends and workflows.
- **Limitations:**
  - Record limits and sync quotas on lower tiers; scaling large datasets can be costly.
  - Performance degrades with heavy formulas/links; no complex transactions.
  - Interfaces feature still growing; advanced UI patterns limited.
- **Best for:** Single-source-of-truth databases, lightweight CRMs, and data backends for no-code apps.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Free for small bases; paid adds higher limits, sync, automations, and permissions.
- **Notable integrations:** Native API, forms, sync, Airtable Automations, Zapier/Make, Softr/Glide/Retool connectors.

- **Evaluation notes:**
  - Strong for relational-lite schemas and views; lacks full transactions, migrations, and referential integrity guarantees.
  - Permissions cover bases, tables, and fields; granular controls and audit logs improve on paid tiers but no customer-managed keys.
  - API is consistent and well-documented; rate limits and record caps drive teams to sync/warehouse as they scale.

# AppSheet
**Category:** Mobile/web app builder (data-driven)

- **Summary:** Google-owned builder that generates apps from Sheets/SQL with rules and offline-friendly clients.
- **Strengths:**
  - Strong data connectors (Sheets, SQL, Salesforce) and offline sync.
  - Expressions allow conditional logic and workflow automation.
  - Enterprise security, governance, and deployment controls.
- **Limitations:**
  - UI is functional, not highly customizable; branding options are limited.
  - Complex UX flows can be hard to design; feels form-centric.
  - Pricing per active user can add up for large audiences.
- **Best for:** Field apps, inspections, inventory, and ops workflows tied to existing data.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Free prototype; paid tiers per active user with governance features.
- **Notable integrations:** Google Workspace, Sheets/SQL connectors, Apps Script, webhooks, Zapier/Make.

- **Evaluation notes:**
  - Data comes from Sheets/SQL/Drive; schema inference is good but complex relationships and migrations need manual care.
  - Security inherits from Google ecosystem with SSO and policy controls; row-level filters exist but version control is basic.
  - Offline and mobile capabilities are solid; performance depends heavily on source data latency and app complexity.

**Category:** Internal tool builder (open-source)

- **Summary:** Open-source platform for building internal tools with drag-and-drop UI and JS logic.
- **Strengths:**
  - Self-hostable with community edition; good for data control and extensibility.
  - JS everywhere pattern allows custom logic without leaving the UI.
  - Git workflows, environments, and RBAC available on paid tiers.
- **Limitations:**
  - Public app experiences limited; primarily internal-use-focused.
  - Performance and component polish behind Retool in some cases.
  - Requires JS comfort; not fully no-code for complex apps.
- **Best for:** Internal dashboards/CRUD apps where open-source and self-hosting are priorities.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Free OSS; cloud/self-host business tiers for SSO, audit, advanced RBAC.
- **Notable integrations:** Databases, REST/GraphQL, SaaS connectors, JS libraries, Git sync, webhooks.

- **Evaluation notes:**
  - Self-host or cloud; connects to DBs/REST/GraphQL with JS logic; no-first-class migrations or model enforcement.
  - RBAC, audit, and SSO land in business/enterprise tiers; OSS gives control but governance is DIY.
  - Performance is good for CRUD dashboards; heavy data grids and complex JS may need caching/pagination tuning.

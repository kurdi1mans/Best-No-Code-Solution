# Backendless
**Category:** Backend/DB/API builder

- **Summary:** No-code/low-code backend with visual data modeling, user management, file storage, and API generation.
- **Strengths:**
  - Visual data schema, geolocation, auth, and real-time messaging out of the box.
  - Auto-generated REST/GraphQL APIs and serverless cloud code for custom logic.
  - Codeless logic builder and UI builder option for simple front-ends.
- **Limitations:**
  - Complex business logic may need JavaScript/Java Cloud Code; debugging can be opaque.
  - Vendor lock-in for data and functions; migrations require effort.
  - Pricing and limits scale with API calls, storage, and features.
- **Best for:** Teams needing a fast backend/API with auth and real-time for web/mobile apps.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Free tier; paid plans increase calls/storage, add environments, and enterprise features.
- **Notable integrations:** REST/GraphQL APIs, Cloud Code, messaging, file storage, geolocation, FlutterFlow/Bubble connectors, Zapier/Make via webhooks.

- **Evaluation notes:**
  - Backend-as-a-service with database, auth, and serverless functions; schema tools exist but deep migrations are manual.
  - Offers user roles, row-level permissions, and file storage rules; compliance posture depends on cloud vs. self-hosted Managed service.
  - Real-time APIs and messaging are built-in; scaling is decent for mid-volume, but vendor lock-in to Backendless runtime is high.

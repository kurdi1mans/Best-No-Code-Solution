**Category:** Open-source database/spreadsheet

- **Summary:** Airtable-like open-source database with self-hosting, API, and plugin model.
- **Strengths:**
  - Open-source and self-hostable; good for data residency and customization.
  - Database and table-level permissions; row limits more flexible than SaaS tiers.
  - REST API and real-time updates suitable for front-end tools.
- **Limitations:**
  - UI less polished than Airtable; fewer built-in automations.
  - Smaller template and integration ecosystem.
  - Self-hosting requires DevOps if not on cloud offering.
- **Best for:** Teams needing Airtable-like UX with self-hosting, higher limits, or open-source extensibility.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Community free/self-host; paid cloud for seats, automations, SSO, support.
- **Notable integrations:** REST API, webhook triggers, plugin system, n8n/Make/Zapier connectors.

- **Evaluation notes:**
  - Open-source Airtable-like with Postgres backend; strong for self-hosted schemas and basic views, weaker for complex workflows.
  - Permissions improving (row-level in premium); SSO/audit in enterprise; self-host gives data residency control.
  - API and plugin model are growing; automations and integrations remain lighter than Airtable/SmartSuite.

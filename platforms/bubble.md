# Bubble
**Category:** Web app builder

- **Summary:** Drag-and-drop editor with visual workflows, database, and hosting for building full web applications.
- **Strengths:**
  - Powerful workflow engine, logic, and plugin marketplace for APIs/payments/auth.
  - Data modeling, privacy rules, and deployments handled in-platform.
  - Robust community templates and plugins reduce build time.
- **Limitations:**
  - Performance tuning can be tricky on complex pages; requires Bubble-specific knowledge.
  - Version control and team collaboration less familiar to engineers; vendor lock-in.
  - Native mobile support relies on wrappers; responsive design can need careful setup.
- **Best for:** MVPs and SaaS-style web apps without deep custom frontend needs.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Free dev tier; paid tiers unlock custom domains, capacity, and collaboration.
- **Notable integrations:** Stripe, OAuth, API connector, plugin marketplace, Zapier/Make.

- **Evaluation notes:**
  - Full-stack visual builder with proprietary runtime; strong for rapid MVPs but limited portability and version control depth.
  - Built-in auth, privacy rules, and role controls; needs careful design for row-level security and performance on large datasets.
  - Scaling relies on Bubble hosting; debugging, DevOps, and testing support are improving but less mature than code stacks.

# ClickUp Tables
**Category:** Work management with database-like tables

- **Summary:** Part of ClickUp's productivity suite; provides table views and custom fields for tasks and lightweight databases.
- **Strengths:**
  - Integrated with tasks/docs/goals; tables can tie directly to work execution.
  - Custom fields, views (table/board/calendar), and automations help model simple databases.
  - Good for teams already using ClickUp for project management.
- **Limitations:**
  - Not a full database; relational modeling is basic compared to Airtable/Smartsuite.
  - API and formula capabilities are limited; complex data apps not suited.
  - Performance and clutter can be issues in large workspaces.
- **Best for:** Teams standardized on ClickUp who need simple data tables linked to tasks without adding another tool.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Free tier; paid tiers add users, automation limits, advanced permissions, and integrations.
- **Notable integrations:** ClickUp API, native integrations (Slack/Drive/etc.), Zapier/Make, webhooks.

- **Evaluation notes:**
  - Tables sit inside ClickUp work management; schema flexibility is limited and not ideal for relational data.
  - Permissions mirror ClickUp spaces/folders; audit history exists but field-level security is thin.
  - Integrations rely on ClickUp API and automations; better suited for lightweight lists than system-of-record needs.

**Category:** Docs with database-like tables

- **Summary:** Document platform with relational tables, formulas, and packs used for knowledge bases, workflows, and lightweight apps.
- **Strengths:**
  - Powerful table formulas and buttons enable app-like behaviors inside docs.
  - Packs marketplace connects to external services; automations for triggers.
  - Flexible layouts mix narrative docs with structured data.
- **Limitations:**
  - Performance can lag on very large docs/tables; row limits apply per doc.
  - Public/embedded experiences are doc-centric; not a full site/app builder.
  - Pricing scales with doc makers; permissions model differs from traditional DBs.
- **Best for:** Knowledge bases, lightweight CRMs/trackers, and team hubs combining docs + data.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Free tier; paid for automation limits, packs, and granular permissions; enterprise for SSO/GRC.
- **Notable integrations:** Packs (Salesforce/Jira/Slack/etc.), APIs, webhooks, automations, Zapier/Make connectors.

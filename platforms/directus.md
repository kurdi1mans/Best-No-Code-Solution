**Category:** Open-source data platform / headless CMS

- **Summary:** Open-source layer that turns SQL databases into an API + admin app with roles, flows, and content management.
- **Strengths:**
  - Connects to existing SQL (Postgres/MySQL/SQLite/etc.) without owning your data; generates REST/GraphQL APIs.
  - Rich admin UI for collections, relations, permissions, file library, and data workflows.
  - Extensible with hooks, custom endpoints, and extensions; self-host or use cloud.
- **Limitations:**
  - Requires DB hosting/ops; not a turnkey database service.
  - UI is CMS/admin-centric; not an end-user app builder.
  - Complex business logic may need custom hooks/services.
- **Best for:** Teams wanting a headless CMS/admin/API on top of their SQL databases with open-source control.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Free OSS; cloud pricing by projects/usage with enterprise support options.
- **Notable integrations:** REST/GraphQL, webhooks/flows, SSO, storage adapters, custom extensions, Zapier/Make via API.

# FlutterFlow
**Category:** Web & mobile app builder (low-code)

- **Summary:** Visual builder for Flutter apps with drag-and-drop UI, logic flows, and deployable web/mobile outputs.
- **Strengths:**
  - Generates Flutter code with support for custom widgets and inline Dart for flexibility.
  - Integrates with Firebase (Auth/Firestore/Storage), Supabase, REST/GraphQL, and native device features.
  - Reusable components, themes, and responsive layouts accelerate production-ready apps.
- **Limitations:**
  - Complex logic still benefits from Dart knowledge; debugging can require code export.
  - Performance and bundle sizes depend on build choices; needs care for large apps.
  - Team collaboration/versioning lighter than traditional VCS workflows.
- **Best for:** Startups and teams needing cross-platform apps fast, with ability to extend via Flutter code.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Free tier; paid adds custom domains, team seats, higher build limits, and advanced features.
- **Notable integrations:** Firebase, Supabase, REST/GraphQL APIs, Stripe, Algolia, custom actions in Dart, app store deploys.

# Jotform
**Category:** Form builder

- **Summary:** Form builder with wide widget library, payment support, and approvals for business workflows.
- **Strengths:**
  - Large template and widget ecosystem (payments, signatures, calculations, PDF generation).
  - Approval flows, conditional logic, and reporting built in.
  - Supports HIPAA (on eligible plans) and enterprise features.
- **Limitations:**
  - Form UX can be more traditional vs. conversational builders like Typeform.
  - Complex apps beyond forms need external tools; data modeling is form-centric.
  - Pricing scales with submissions, storage, and HIPAA/enterprise features.
- **Best for:** Business forms with payments/signatures/approvals and compliance needs.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Free tier with limits; paid tiers add submissions, storage, HIPAA, and enterprise options.
- **Notable integrations:** Payments (Stripe/PayPal/etc.), CRMs, Google Sheets, Webhooks, Zapier/Make, PDF builder, approvals.

- **Evaluation notes:**
  - Great for rich forms and approvals; database backend is simple and better as intake not system-of-record.
  - HIPAA and compliance options exist on higher tiers; field-level permissions and audit logs are limited on lower plans.
  - Integrations and PDFs are strong; scaling works for large submission volumes but complex business logic may need webhooks.

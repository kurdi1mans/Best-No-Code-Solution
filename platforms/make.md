# Make (formerly Integromat)
**Category:** Automation/integration

- **Summary:** Scenario-based automation with visual data flow, routers, and granular operations.
- **Strengths:**
  - Detailed control over mapping, iterators, and branching; good for complex workflows.
  - Competitive pricing for high operation counts vs. Zapier.
  - Real-time execution viewer aids debugging.
- **Limitations:**
  - Learning curve is higher; JSON concepts often needed.
  - Connector library smaller than Zapier for niche apps.
  - Hosted-only; no first-party self-hosting.
- **Best for:** Complex multi-branch automations, data processing, and cost-sensitive high volume.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Free tier with limited ops; paid tiers scale by operations and data transfers.
- **Notable integrations:** App connectors, HTTP module, webhooks, iterators/aggregators, data stores.

- **Evaluation notes:**
  - Visual dataflow builder with wide connector set; supports branching/loops but lacks strong type/contracts per step.
  - Error handling, retries, and execution logs are solid; self-host not available so data residency tied to vendor regions.
  - Pricing by operations can spike with chatty APIs; high-volume flows benefit from queues/batching design.

**Category:** Enterprise low-code app platform

- **Summary:** Enterprise-grade low-code platform for building web/mobile apps with visual modeling, workflows, and integrations.
- **Strengths:**
  - Model-driven development with strong governance, versioning, and team collaboration.
  - Connectors for SAP/Oracle/REST/GraphQL, workflows, and microservices deployment to cloud or on-prem.
  - Supports both no-code (Microflow) and low-code (Java/JS actions) to extend complex logic.
- **Limitations:**
  - Licensing and infrastructure costs are high; vendor lock-in to platform runtime.
  - Learning curve for modeling concepts; complex apps benefit from developer expertise.
  - UI flexibility bounded by provided components/themes compared to custom frameworks.
- **Best for:** Enterprises needing governed, integrated apps with faster delivery than custom builds and hybrid teams (dev + business).
- **Pricing snapshot:** Free tier for small apps; paid tiers for production scale, environments, and enterprise support.
- **Notable integrations:** SAP, databases, REST/GraphQL, SSO (Azure AD/Okta), CI/CD, private cloud/on-prem deployment.

- **Evaluation notes:**
  - Enterprise low-code with strong modeling and microflows; supports on-prem/cloud with integrations to SAP/REST/OData.
  - Robust governance: environments, transport packages, SSO/SCIM, monitoring, and quality gates are mature.
  - Runtime is heavyweight; licensing and proprietary stack create lock-in, though performance scales with proper sizing.

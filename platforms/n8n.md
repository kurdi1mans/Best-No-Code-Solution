**Category:** Automation/integration (open-source)

- **Summary:** Node-based workflow automation with self-hosting option and JavaScript-friendly nodes.
- **Strengths:**
  - Open-source with self-hosting; good for data control and custom nodes.
  - Code nodes enable complex logic without leaving the flow.
  - Fair-use license for hosted use; cloud offering available.
- **Limitations:**
  - Self-hosting requires setup/maintenance; cloud limits executions on lower tiers.
  - Connector library smaller than Zapier; community nodes vary in quality.
  - Debugging and reliability depend on hosting environment.
- **Best for:** Teams wanting automation with self-hosting, custom logic, and budget control.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Free self-host; cloud priced by executions and features.
- **Notable integrations:** HTTP/Webhook nodes, code nodes, databases, message queues, community nodes.

- **Evaluation notes:**
  - Self-hostable automation with nodes for many services; type-safety is loose and complex flows need testing.
  - Open-core model: SSO, RBAC, audit in enterprise; self-host gives full data control and extensibility.
  - Scaling requires queue/workers and external DB/Redis; good for developers comfortable operating infrastructure.

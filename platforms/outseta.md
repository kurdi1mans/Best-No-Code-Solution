**Category:** SaaS toolkit (auth, billing, CRM, support)

- **Summary:** All-in-one layer for SaaS apps providing auth, subscriptions, CRM, email, and help desk tools without stitching multiple vendors.
- **Strengths:**
  - Fast to add sign-up, login, billing, and subscription management with hosted widgets and API.
  - Built-in CRM, email automation, and support tools reduce vendor sprawl for early-stage SaaS.
  - Simple pricing tied to revenue with generous early tiers.
- **Limitations:**
  - Front-end customization is limited to provided widgets/snippets; deep UX control may need custom code.
  - Primarily B2B/B2C SaaS billing; less suited for complex usage-based pricing without customization.
  - All-in-one model may be redundant once teams outgrow bundled tools.
- **Best for:** Early-stage SaaS needing quick auth + billing + CRM/support without assembling a stack.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Revenue-based tiers with low entry cost; higher tiers add seats/features.
- **Notable integrations:** JavaScript widgets, REST API, Webflow/Next.js examples, Stripe, Zapier/Make, webhooks.

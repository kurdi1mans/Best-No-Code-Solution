**Category:** Enterprise low-code app platform

- **Summary:** Full-stack low-code platform for enterprise web/mobile apps with visual UI, workflows, and integrations.
- **Strengths:**
  - End-to-end stack (UI, logic, data) with enterprise features: SSO, governance, monitoring, CI/CD.
  - Strong connectors for databases, SAP/Oracle/REST/GraphQL, and background processes.
  - Generates native mobile builds and responsive web apps with role-based access.
- **Limitations:**
  - Steep licensing costs and vendor lock-in; expertise is platform-specific.
  - Development still benefits from programming knowledge for complex logic/performance.
  - Heavier runtime footprint and proprietary components vs. lightweight no-code tools.
- **Best for:** Enterprises needing governed, integrated apps faster than custom builds with centralized ops.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Free personal edition; commercial licenses priced per app/endpoints/environments with enterprise support.
- **Notable integrations:** SAP/Oracle/SQL connectors, REST/GraphQL, Azure AD/Okta SSO, background jobs, DevOps pipelines.

- **Evaluation notes:**
  - Full-stack low-code with strong integration to enterprise systems; supports on-prem/private cloud with CI/CD tooling.
  - Mature governance: SSO/SCIM, fine-grained permissions, logging, and controlled promotion between environments.
  - Proprietary runtime and licensing create lock-in; performance is good when apps are optimized but footprint is heavy.

# Microsoft Power Apps
**Category:** Enterprise low-code app platform

- **Summary:** Part of Microsoft Power Platform for building canvas/model-driven apps tied to Microsoft 365, Dataverse, and external data.
- **Strengths:**
  - Deep integration with Microsoft 365/Teams, Dataverse, SharePoint, Dynamics, and Azure.
  - Connectors library, Power Fx formulas, and Power Automate for workflows.
  - Role-based security, environment governance, and ALM with solutions.
- **Limitations:**
  - Best suited inside Microsoft ecosystem; external users and non-Microsoft data can add licensing complexity.
  - UI/UX flexibility is constrained compared to custom frontends; performance varies with complex screens.
  - Licensing can be confusing (per app/per user) and costly at scale outside M365 entitlements.
- **Best for:** Organizations on Microsoft 365 building internal apps rapidly with existing data and identity.
- **Pricing snapshot:** M365-inclusive features for some scenarios; per-app and per-user plans for broader use; additional costs for external users and premium connectors.
- **Notable integrations:** Dataverse, SharePoint, SQL, Dynamics, Azure services, custom connectors, Power Automate flows, Teams embedding.

- **Evaluation notes:**
  - Integrates deeply with Microsoft 365/Dataverse; supports model-driven apps and canvas apps with connectors.
  - Strong enterprise controls: DLP, environments, ALM pipelines, SSO/SCIM, audit, and row-level security via Dataverse.
  - Licensing and capacity add complexity; performance depends on Dataverse connectors and delegation limits.

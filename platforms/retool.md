# Retool
**Category:** Internal tool builder (low-code/no-code)

- **Summary:** Drag-and-drop UI with SQL/JS bindings for building internal dashboards and CRUD apps.
- **Strengths:**
  - Strong data connectors, query editor, and JS transforms for flexible logic.
  - Component library fits internal tools (tables, forms, charts) with RBAC and audit trails.
  - Self-hosting and enterprise features (SSO, on-prem connectors).
- **Limitations:**
  - Requires comfort with SQL/JS for anything beyond simple CRUD (leans low-code).
  - Pricing per user can be high for large audiences.
  - Public-facing apps less polished; theming limited.
- **Best for:** Internal dashboards, admin panels, and CRUD apps on existing databases/APIs.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Free for small teams; paid per user for permissions, versioning, and environments.
- **Notable integrations:** Databases, GraphQL/REST, S3/GCS, Python/JS runtimes, Git sync, Zapier/Make via webhooks.

- **Evaluation notes:**
  - Fast internal tool builder with strong data connectors; typed queries and transformers help but schema enforcement is external.
  - Enterprise governance is solid (RBAC, SSO/SCIM, audit logs, environments, versioning); self-host option for data control.
  - Performance is good for dashboards/CRUD; complex client logic may need custom components or JS queries.

# Rows
**Category:** Web spreadsheet (SaaS)

- **Summary:** Modern web spreadsheet with built-in integrations, templates, and sharing for data work and light dashboards.
- **Strengths:**
  - Native integrations (APIs, databases, SaaS) exposed as functions; good for live data sheets.
  - Sharing, embeds, and public dashboards make distribution easy.
  - Modern UX with forms and automations; familiar spreadsheet logic.
- **Limitations:**
  - Not a full database; relational modeling is limited compared to Airtable.
  - Complex app experiences require external front-ends.
  - Limits on refresh rates and API calls on lower tiers.
- **Best for:** Teams needing live spreadsheets with integrations for reporting, lead lists, and lightweight dashboards.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Free tier; paid adds higher automation/refresh limits, collaboration, and branding for embeds.
- **Notable integrations:** HTTP/SQL connectors, HubSpot/Notion/Sheets/Slack, webhooks, API, embeds, Zapier/Make.

- **Evaluation notes:**
  - Spreadsheet with built-in APIs and automations; good for SMB ops data but lacks strict modeling and migrations.
  - Sharing/permissions are simple; SSO/audit on higher tiers but no deep row-level security.
  - Automation quotas and API rate limits shape scale; suited for modest datasets vs. warehouse workloads.

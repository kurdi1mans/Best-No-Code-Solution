**Category:** Open-source app builder (database + UI)

- **Summary:** Open-source platform for building web apps on Postgres with a GUI for data models, pages, and workflows.
- **Strengths:**
  - Visual schema builder with plugins for field types and authentication.
  - Drag-and-drop page builder for lists/forms plus actions, triggers, and roles.
  - Self-hostable; plugin ecosystem for integrations and widgets.
- **Limitations:**
  - UI and UX less polished than commercial tools; smaller community.
  - Performance and scalability depend on your hosting; requires Postgres setup.
  - Complex logic may need custom plugins or code; limited mobile-specific support.
- **Best for:** Makers wanting an OSS stack to build CRUD-style web apps on Postgres without starting from scratch.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Free OSS/self-host; hosted plans available with support and backups.
- **Notable integrations:** Plugin system (auth/providers/fields), REST API, webhooks, scheduled tasks, Zapier/Make via API.

- **Evaluation notes:**
  - Open-source app builder with Postgres backend; supports custom plugins and data modeling but limited guardrails.
  - Security depends on configuration; roles exist but auditing/SSO require custom setup or plugins.
  - Good for small custom apps when you want OSS control; scaling and UX polish need engineering effort.

# Shopify
**Category:** E-commerce platform

- **Summary:** Hosted e-commerce platform with storefront builder, checkout, and app ecosystem.
- **Strengths:**
  - World-class checkout, payments, and fulfillment tooling.
  - Theme store and app marketplace cover most commerce features (subscriptions, reviews, shipping).
  - Scales from small shops to enterprise with Shopify Plus.
- **Limitations:**
  - Theme customization can require Liquid/low-code; design flexibility within theme constraints.
  - App fees add up; performance varies by theme/apps.
  - Content management for non-commerce pages is basic.
- **Best for:** Online stores needing reliable checkout and plug-and-play commerce stack.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Basic/Shopify/Advanced tiers; Plus for enterprise; transaction fees without Shopify Payments.
- **Notable integrations:** App store, POS, Shopify Functions, sales channels, Zapier/Make, Hydrogen/Storefront API.

- **Evaluation notes:**
  - Opinionated commerce platform; strong product/checkout APIs but custom data models require metafields/apps.
  - PCI compliance and security handled by Shopify; granular staff permissions exist but multi-tenant/B2B complexity needs Plus.
  - App ecosystem is deep; performance and scale are solid on hosted infra though locked to Shopify architecture.

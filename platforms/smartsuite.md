# SmartSuite
**Category:** Database/spreadsheet hybrid

- **Summary:** Airtable-like work management platform with flexible records, views, and automations for teams.
- **Strengths:**
  - Variety of field types, views (grid, kanban, timeline, Gantt), and templates for PM/CRM/ops.
  - Automations, forms, permissions, and reporting are built in for team workflows.
  - More generous record/attachment limits on mid tiers than some competitors.
- **Limitations:**
  - Ecosystem and API maturity behind Airtable; fewer third-party integrations.
  - Interface customizations and app-like experiences are limited compared to Softr/Glide front-ends.
  - Vendor lock-in for data/automation; export options are improving but finite.
- **Best for:** Teams wanting Airtable-style flexibility for projects/CRM/ops with predictable limits and built-in automation.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Free tier; paid plans expand records, storage, automations, and permissions.
- **Notable integrations:** Native automations, Zapier/Make, webhooks, API, forms, external sync connectors in progress.

- **Evaluation notes:**
  - Airtable-like with richer project/record templates; relational modeling is flexible but lacks strict constraints/transactions.
  - Permissions include roles, field-level controls, and record assignments; audit trails are built-in on paid tiers.
  - Automations and dashboards are strong for ops teams; API and integrations are growing but smaller than Airtable.

**Category:** Web app/portal builder (Airtable/DB front-end)

- **Summary:** Block-based builder that turns Airtable or databases into portals, directories, and lightweight apps.
- **Strengths:**
  - Fast to build secure portals with roles, payments, and gated content.
  - Good SEO defaults and performance compared to heavier app builders.
  - Templates for client portals, marketplaces, member areas.
- **Limitations:**
  - Heavily tied to Airtable/Postgres connectors; limited complex logic.
  - Custom UI control is block-based; less granular than Bubble.
  - Advanced workflows often require external automation tools.
- **Best for:** Client portals, member directories, and data-driven sites on Airtable/Postgres.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Free tier; paid plans add users, records, roles, and custom domain/branding.
- **Notable integrations:** Airtable, Google Sheets, Postgres, Stripe, Zapier/Make, webhooks.

- **Evaluation notes:**
  - Front-end for Airtable/Google Sheets/DBs; no data storage of its own, so schema control lives in the backend.
  - Role-based and row-level access via data source filters; SSO and audit available on higher tiers.
  - Good for portals and marketplaces; performance tied to data source latency and caching strategy.

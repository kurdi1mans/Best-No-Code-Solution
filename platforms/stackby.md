**Category:** Database/spreadsheet hybrid

- **Summary:** Airtable-like database with column types, views, and built-in API connectors for SMB teams.
- **Strengths:**
  - Multiple views (grid, kanban, calendar) and column types with templates for marketing/ops.
  - Built-in API connectors and automations to pull data (e.g., YouTube, SERP) into tables on schedules.
  - Pricing can be friendlier for higher row limits than some competitors.
- **Limitations:**
  - UI/UX less polished than Airtable; collaboration features lighter.
  - Integration ecosystem smaller; may rely on native connectors or Zapier/Make.
  - Advanced app-like experiences need external front-ends.
- **Best for:** SMB teams needing database-style tracking with periodic data pulls and generous limits.
- **Pricing snapshot:** Free tier; paid adds rows, automations, API calls, and workspaces.
- **Notable integrations:** Native API connectors (YouTube/SEMrush/etc.), REST API, webhooks, Zapier/Make.
